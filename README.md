# STM32F401VE-MCU-Drivers
Developing and simulating some drivers for STM32 peripherals using C programming.

- **[C problems](https://github.com/omarshaban02/C_problems)**
2. **[Keypad Lock System](https://github.com/omarshaban02/STM32F401VE-Password_Security_System):**\
A simple embedded system allows users to enter a password using a keypad. Once the correct password is entered,
the system unlocks and activates an LED. The system is designed to be easily customizable and extensible for different applications.
3. **[Traffic light LEDs controller](https://github.com/omarshaban02/STM32F401VE-Traffic_Control_System):**\
the program turns on the Red LED as the road must stop to make the people pass the road and after a specific time, the Green LED turns on as it lets the cars cross the roads.
3. **[Interrupt Control](https://github.com/omarshaban02/STM32F401VE-Interrupt_Control):**\
a simple embedded system that uses a 7-segment display to show a counter value, with external interrupts for incrementing and decrementing the counter.
4. **[RGB LED controller](https://github.com/omarshaban02/STM32F401VE-RGB_LED-Interfacing):**\
The system consists of 1 push button and 1 RGB LED. The Push button is connected to PORTB pin 3.
The 3 LED pins are connected to port B pins 5, 6 and 7. The Push button is active low, without an external pull-up resistor.
